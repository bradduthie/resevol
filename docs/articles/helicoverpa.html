<p>The helicoverpa R package is used to simulate individual-based models of agricultural production, pesticide application, and the evolution of pesticide resistance on a spatially explicit landscape. Individual pests are modelled with any number of quantitative traits that have a customisable covariance structure. Covarying trait values are underlied by a pre-specified number of loci and a complex network mapping loci to traits, all of which are specified at the individual level in explicit pest genomes. Simulation requires two steps, each carried out by a separate R function. Step one is run with the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function; it finds individual genomes that produce appropriately covarying traits given allele values that are drawn from a standard normal distribution. Step two is run with the <code>run_farm_sim</code> function; it initialises individuals with the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> output, then simulates agricultural management in the presence of evolving pests. Here we demonstrate the use of these two functions and offer tips for doing so most effectively.</p>

<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#the-mine_gmatrix-function" class="anchor"></a><a name="mine_gmatrix">The <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function</a>
</h1>
<p>The goal of the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function is to map a set of random standard normal (mean = 0, stdev = 1) values to a set of covarying values using a network of hidden layers. The set of random standard normal values in this case are allele values for a positive integer value of loci. The set of covarying values are the traits that take a pre-specified covariance structure, which is represented by a square variance covariance matrix. An example below includes 12 loci (green circles) and four traits (red diamonds), which are linked through three hidden layers of nodes (blue squares).</p>
<div class="figure">

Figure 1: Network mapping loci to traits through an intermediate set of hidden layers in the mine_gmatrix function
</p>
</div>
<p>Each arrow in the figure above is initialised as a number in the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to find a set of arrow values that produces traits with the pre-specified covariance structure given a set of randomly drawn standard normal allele values at loci. The details of this evolutionary algorithm are explained in a separate vignette, but the general idea is that a large set of random networks (i.e., arrow values in the diagram above) are initialised, and the networks that produce traits with a covariance structure most similar to the pre-specified one produce a new generation of networks with some degree of mutation and recombination. Generations continue to evolve until either the maximum number of allowed generations is reached or the network produces traits with a covariance structure that is sufficiently close to the pre-specified one. As an example, we can consider the covariance matrix below.</p>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4]
## [1,]  1.0 -0.5  0.2  0.2
## [2,] -0.5  1.0  0.2  0.2
## [3,]  0.2  0.2  1.0 -0.5
## [4,]  0.2  0.2 -0.5  1.0</code></pre>
<p>This matrix models the pre-specified covariance among four traits. We can assign it as <code>gmt</code> and use it in the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function to find a network that will produce traits with this covariance structure given random standard normal allele values at each loci.</p>

<p>Running the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> function can take several minutes to several hours (or longer) depending on the parameters used. The time required scales exponentially with the dimensions of <code>gmatrix</code> (i.e., the number of traits that need to be found). Default argument values are specified in attempt to be efficient across a wide range of conditions, but in practice it is often best to experiment with different values. As with any evolving population, selection is more effective in larger populations (i.e., high <code>npsize</code>), but large populations are also more time consuming to simulate. The <code>indivs</code> argument can be increased to give more precision when comparing the fitness of networks. Values of <code>sd_ini</code> are usually most effective when they are roughly an order of magnitude below that of the largest element value of <code>gmatrix</code>. Values of <code>sampleK</code>, <code>chooseK</code>, <code>mu_pr</code>, <code>mu_sd</code>, and <code>pr_cross</code> sometimes require a bit more experimentation to maximise the efficiency of the function in finding solutions. Note that <code>mu_pr</code> and <code>pr_cross</code> are often most effective at values much higher than would be expected in real biological organisms <span class="citation">(Hamblin 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>When <code>mine_gmatrix</code> is running, the generation number, mean stress (i.e., log mean squared deviation of the covariance matrix elements from <code>gmatrix</code>), and minimum stress will be printed in the console (this can be turned off by specifying <code>prnt_out = FALSE</code>). Below shows how the console output will appear.</p>

<p>The fifth element of <code>mine_gmatrix</code> is a matrix that shows the marginal effect of each locus (rows) on each trait (columns) value. Note that this is this is the product of <code>mg_v1[[3]]</code> times each layer of <code>mg_v1[[4]]</code> in sequence (i.e., <code>mg_v1[[4]][,,1]</code> times <code>mg_v1[[4]][,,2]</code>, and so forth). Conceptually, this matrix isolates the effect of each locus on each trait if all other loci are held at a constant value.</p>

<p>The sixth element of <code>mine_gmatrix</code> is a matrix of the observed covariance structure of traits given a set of <code>indivs</code> individuals with random standard normal values at each locus. This matrix can be compared to the pre-specified <code>gmatrix</code>. While there will always be small deviations that are minimised by the function, it might often be useful to check the difference between matrices manually.</p>

<p>The seventh element of <code>mine_gmatrix</code> is a vectorisation of <code>mg_v1[[3]]</code> and <code>mg_v1[[4]]</code>. That is, a vector that includes all of the information needed to map a set of allele values to trait values (i.e., values for all arrows shown in Figure 1). This vector of network values is inserted into the genome of each individual during a simulation, so each individual’s allele values can then be mapped to their appropriate trait values. Simulations can then be run in which these network values are static, or in which they may evolve at any number of paths from layer to layer (i.e., columns of arrows in Figure 1).</p>

That is, the logged expected squared deviation of each element in the observed covariance matrix from the pre-specified covariance matrix (note, small deviations might arise between this value and the value obtained from manually comparing <code>mg_v1[[2]]</code> and <code>mg_v1[[6]]</code> due to a different set of <code>indivs</code> individuals being used to produce <code>mg_v1[[6]]</code> and calculate <code>mg_v1[[8]]</code> below).</p>

<p>The output of <code>mine_gmatrix</code> is necessary for initialising new individuals in the individual-based model. The individual-based model is run using the <code>run_farm_sim</code> function, which is explained in the next section.</p>

<a href="#the-run_farm_sim-function" class="anchor"></a><a name="run_farm_sim">The <code>run_farm_sim</code> function</a>
</h1>
<p>Simulations are run using the <code>run_farm_sim</code> function, which initialises a spatially explicit landscape and individual pests, then simulates the population and evolutionary dynamics of those pests for a specific landscape management regime of crop use and pesticide application. The simulation terminates after a fixed number of time steps have passed, or if the population goes extinct. Because of the way that events occur within the simulation (e.g., demographic processes of individuals, changes in landscape properties), time steps do not have a fixed interpretation (e.g., one growing season or year). Instead, arguments to <code>run_farm_sim</code> must be carefully considered to effectively model the social-ecological system. Similarly, the order of events in the life-cycle of individuals is not inherently fixed, but is instead defined by the minimum and maximum age at which movement, reproduction, and feeding occur for individuals in the population. How this works is presented in more detail with the explanation of time steps in <code>run_farm_sim</code>. We first explain the inputs.</p>

If 1, then loci and the first column of arrows (green circles to first column of blue squares in Figure 1) can mutate. If 2, then the first two columns of arrows in Figure 1 can mutate, and so forth. Fewer mutation layers will constrain the covariance among traits, while more mutation layers will allow the covariance structure to evolve more readily.</td>

<p>To model a similar system with overlapping generations, parameters could be set with <code>max_age &gt; 1</code> and a very high <code>baseline_metabolism</code> (i.e., high enough so that food consumption gains can only apply to the current time step), and otherwise identical parameters.

<p>To model a system in which individuals develop in a sedentary life history stage that persists until a final stage of movement and reproduction (e.g., an insect with a larval and pupal stage), parameters could be set with min and max ages of feeding and pesticide consumption from 0 to 3, with min and max ages of movement and reproduction set at 4, <code>max_age = 4</code>, and <code>baseline_metabolism = 0</code>. Hence, food or pesticide consumption accrued in early life history stages would affect reproductive output in a later life history stage.</p>

<p>It might often be useful to think of <code>crop_rotation_time</code> and <code>pesticide_rotation_time</code> as defining the length of a season, with minimum and maximum ages for individuals defining the relative length of their life history processes. It is important to emphasise that crops are not replenished in each time step, so if, e.g., half of the food on a cell is eaten in a time step, then the amount of food will not be replenished until the next rotation occurs regardless of whether or not the crop type will change. Note that non-crop and pesticide free land can be created by creating more crops or pesticides than can be consumed (e.g., in the above simulation, by setting <code>crop_number = 3</code> and <code>pesticide_number = 3</code>, areas of the landscape would be generated with effectively no crops or pesticides because the default <code>food_consume</code> and <code>pesticide_consume</code> for the third crop and pesticide would be zero).</p>

<p>The output of <code>run_farm_sim</code> to the console is a list of two elements. The first element is just a list of parameter values run in the model, and the second element is a three dimensional array of the landscape. The most useful output will be some combination of three CSV files printed off when the simulation is run. The first file is ‘population_data.csv,’ which will provide a large table of population level statistics for each time step in the simulation. This is the smallest and often most useful file. Column names in the file provide information about the data.</p>
<p>The second file is ‘last_time_step.csv,’ which will provide a very large able that includes the characteristics (columns) of all individuals (rows) in the last time step of the simulation. This file can be used to make inferences about individual-level variation in the population (e.g., spatial distribution of individuals, correlations between traits and fitness). The number of columns will vary based on simulation parameters, and column names are not currently printed. Nevertheless, a few relevant column numbers are consistent in the information that they provide about an individual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Col 1. Time step</li>
<li>Col 2. Individual ID</li>
<li>Col 3. x-location</li>
<li>Col 4. y-location</li>
<li>Col 5. Age</li>
<li>Col 6. Sex</li>
<li>Col 7. Movement distance</li>
<li>Col 8. Mother ID</li>
<li>Col 9. Father ID</li>
<li>Col 12. Offspring produced</li>
<li>Col 102. Start of trait values</li>
</ul>
<p>The trait value columns continue for as many traits as are specified by the <code>mine_gmatrix</code> output (<code>mine_output</code> argument in <code>run_farm_sim</code>). This ‘last_time_step.csv’ should be printed out with some care; since the entire genomes of each individual are included, large populations can produce very large file sizes.</p>
<p>The third file is ‘individuals.csv,’ which will provide an extremely large table with every individual in the simulation and all of their characteristics (i.e., the same contents as are in ‘last_time_step.csv,’ but for all time steps). This file should not be made unless a trial simulation has been run with a small number of time steps first to ensure that the CSV file will not become too large to store.</p>

<p>In all of the <a href="#example">examples used</a> above, values were hard coded into the <code>run_farm_sim</code> function, so the four traits mined in <code>mg_v1</code> were not actually used. The helicoverpa package allows evolving traits to be substituted for the following individual characteristics set in the arguments of <code>run_farm_sim</code>: <code>move_distance</code>, <code>food_needed_surv</code>, <code>pesticide_tolerated_surv</code>, <code>food_needed_repr</code>, <code>pesticide_tolerated_repr</code>, <code>mating_distance</code>, <code>lambda_value</code>, <code>movement_bouts</code>, <code>metabolism</code>, <code>food_consume</code> (up to 10 elements), and <code>pesticide_consume</code> (up to 10 elements). When a trait is substituted for the argument, an individual’s value for the argument is determined by the trait (e.g., the food needed to survive can be determined by a trait unique to each individual rather than set as a numerical value that applies to all individuals). Setting an argument to the trait is done by placing “T[n]” in quotes where [n] is the number of the trait (corresponding to the n row and column of the pre-specified trait covariance matrix). Below shows the last <a href="#example">example used above</a>, but with <code>food_consume = c(2, 2)</code> and <code>pesticide_consume = c(0, 0)</code> replaced with evolving traits.</p>
