\value{
The output in the R console is a list with two elements; the first 
element is a vector of parameter values used by the model, and the second 
element is the landscape in the simulation. The most relevant output will be
produced as CSV files within the working directory. When get_stats = TRUE, 
a file named 'population_data.csv' is produced in the working directory. When
print_last = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals and their 
characteristics is printed for the last time step in the working directory in
a file named 'last_time_step.csv' (for large simulations, this file can be 
> 1GB in size). When print_inds = TRUE, a complete array of all individuals 
in all time steps is produced in the working directory in a file named
'individuals.csv' (use this option with extreme caution for all but the
smallest simulations).
}
\description{
Initialises a new set of individuals and then simulates farming over time.
This is the main function that runs individual-based simulations of crop and
pesticide use and the evolution of pesticide resistance over time. To run 
this function, output from the mine_gmatrix function is required to specify
the covariance structure of individual traits and individual genomes. The
arguments to this function are used to initialise a landscape with the 
make_landscape function and initialise individuals with the initialise_inds
function. After initialisation, the simulation continues for up to a set 
number of time steps (unless extinction occurs), and individuals on the
landscape feed, encounter pesticide, move, reproduce, and die depending upon
the arguments specified in this function. After a specified number of time
steps, the crop or pesticide applied to a landscape cell can also change. The
end result is an evolving population of individuals that express traits 
that can potentially affect fitness (e.g., food consumption, pesticide
consumption, movement). Population level statistics are calculated by 
default and printed to a CSV, but individual level data (which includes all 
individual characteristics in a large table) need to be turned on because 
files can become extremely large (use print_inds with extreme caution and
print_last with care).
