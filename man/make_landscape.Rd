\usage{
make_landscape(
  rows,
  cols,
  depth = 21,
  farms = 4,
  public_land = 0,
  farm_var = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rows}{The dimension of the other side of the landscape (e.g., Longitude)}

\item{cols}{The dimension of one side of the landscape (e.g., Latitude)}

\item{depth}{The number of layers in the 3D landscape}

\item{farms}{The number of farms on the landscape}

\item{public_land}{The proportion of landscape cells that are not farmland}

\item{farm_var}{Does the land distribution vary among farms (>=0, <1)}
}
\value{
the_land A cols by rows landscape with randomly distributed cell types
}
\description{
Initialise the landscape for a simulation. This should not normally need to 
be done explicitly with this function because it is run inside of the 
run_farm_sim function, but this gives the option to generate a landscape 
without actually running a simulation.
}
\examples{
land <- make_landscape(rows = 10, cols = 10, depth = 2, farms = 4)
}
