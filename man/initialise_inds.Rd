\arguments{
\item{mine_output}{The output from mine_gmatrix}

\item{N}{Number of individuals to be initialised}

\item{xdim}{Horizontal dimensions of the landscape}

\item{ydim}{Vertical dimensions of the landscape}

\item{repro}{Type of reproduction allowed: "asexual", "sexual", and
"biparental". Note that if repro > 0, this causes a diploid genome.}

\item{neutral_loci}{The number of neutral loci individuals have}

\item{max_age}{The maximum age of an individual}

\item{min_age_move}{The minimum age at which an individual can move}

\item{max_age_move}{The maximum age at which an individual can move}

\item{min_age_reproduce}{The minimum age which an individual can reproduce}

\item{max_age_reproduce}{The maximum age which an individual can reproduce}

\item{min_age_feed}{The minimum age at which an individual feeds}

\item{max_age_feed}{The maximum age at which an individual feeds}

\item{food_consume}{The amount of food consumed during feeding}

\item{pesticide_consume}{Amount of pesticide consumed while on a cell}

\item{rand_age}{Initialise individuals with a random age}

\item{move_distance}{Maximum cells moved in one bout of movement}

\item{food_needed_surv}{Food needed to survive (if over min_age_feed)}

\item{pesticide_tolerated_surv}{Pesticide tolerated by individual}

\item{food_needed_repr}{Food needed to reproduce 1 offspring}

\item{pesticide_tolerated_repr}{Pesticide tolerated to allow reproduction}

\item{reproduction_type}{Poisson reproduction ("lambda") vs "food_based"}

\item{mating_distance}{Distance in cells within which mate is available}

\item{lambda_value}{individual value for poisson reproduction}

\item{movement_bouts}{Number of bouts of movement per time step}

\item{selfing}{If sexual reproduction, is selfing allowed?}

\item{feed_while_moving}{Do individuals feed after each movement bout?}

\item{mortality_type}{Type of mortality (currently only one option)}

\item{age_food_threshold}{Age at which food threshold is enacted}

\item{age_pesticide_threshold}{Age at which pesticide threshold is enacted}
