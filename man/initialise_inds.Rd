\value{
A two-dimensional array of individuals for simulation
}
\description{
Initialise new individuals into the IBM. This function is generally not needed
because it is run inside the run_farm_sim function to generate new individuals
for simulations. To initialise individuals with this function, it is necessary
to set the mine_output argument to output from the mine_gmatrix function. This
output includes all of the information necessary to build individuals with
genomes that produce traits that covary in a pre-specified way. The arguments
of this function include addition information for building the individual
array, which is a two-dimensional array in which each individual occupies a 
row, and each column specifies a character of the individual (including all
genome loci). See vignettes for a more detailed explanation.
